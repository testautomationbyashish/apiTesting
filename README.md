Testcases for Space-X API Testing
Reference documents is https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/blob/master/docs/v4/README.md
1) HAPPY PATH TEST When user does a GET query on baseurl https://api.spacexdata.com/v4 ; AuthType=APIKey; Key=spacex-key ;Add to Header ;he gets back a response with 200 OK status.
2) When user does a GET query on baseurl https://api.spacexdata.com/v4 AuthType=APIKey; Key=SomeRandomValue ;Add to Header ,he does not get back a response. Status code will be 401.
3) When user does a GET query on baseurl https://api.spacexdata.com/v3 , he gets no response. Only v4 is supported.
4) When user does a GET query on https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/company, he should get SpaceX company info. Check address state is "Califormia".
5) Validate the keys with the Min 1 letter and Max more than 256 letters in GET request of APIs.
6) Verify /query route gives more results for pagination.
7) Verify limit": 10 gives only 10 records in pagination results.
8) Verify totalPages": 1, gives only one page result in pagination query.
9) Verify if "hasPrevPage": false then this should be the first page of response.
10) Verify if "hasNextPage": false, then this should be the last page of api response.
11) Verify $text" and "$search" searches all text indexes in a collection. Check that all string fields get indexed
12) Verify the query "upcoming":true gives Next upcoming launch.
13) Verify the query sort":"flight_number":"asc" gives back all flights in ascending order of flight number
14) Verify the query limit: 50 gives only the top 50 records.
15) Verify the query page: 2 gives records of page 2.
16) Verify if date_precision is set to month then response should have correct month. Day can be neglected. For example if launch date is 15June2021 and date_precision is month then response having 2020-06-01T00:00:00.000Z is correct. But 2020-07-15T00:00:00.000Z is wrong.
17) Verify if date is date_utc then response should not have any other timezone except 00.00 hours
18) Verify if date is date_unix then response should not have any other timezone except 00.00 hours
19) Verify if date is date_local then response should be in local country timezone.
20) Verify if date net=true then in response launch date should not be lesser than the set date.
21) Verify Post request to create rocket https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/rockets with name,id and type in body creates a new rocket. User should be able to see this rocket in GET query.
22) Verify GET /capsules gives the list of all capsules.
23) Verify GET /capsules/123 gives the list of capsule 123.
24) Verify GET /capsules/NOtExisting should give result Not Found.
25) Verify POST /capsules/query should create new capsule.
26) Verify  if query is wrong in POST /capsules/query mongoose error is thrown 400 Bad Request.
27) Verify PATCH /capsules/:id updates an already existing capsule id.
28) Verify DELETE /capsules/9784 deletes an already existing capsule id 9784
29) Verify after Deleting id 9784 if user performs GET /capsules/9784 he gets Not Found.
30) Verify GET https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/company query gives back fields such as id,ceo,founder,employees in company info.
31) Verify PATCH /company/123 user should be able to update company info for id=123.
32) All Keys verification. If we have JSON, XML APIs user should verify itâ€™s that all the keys are coming.
33) Perform JSON Schema validation for the response of GET /company.
34) Verify API should not take more than 5 seconds (or the defined threshold value) to generate response.
35) Verify if multiple POST requests are sent through excel utility, they shoudl create data correctly.
36) Verify if id 123 is created by POST with name=ashish1 =>then PATCH changes its name to ashish2=> then DELETE id 123 is done=>Then again POST 123 is done.After  this entire workflow => GET query should finally show id 123 with name=ashish1
37) Verify GET /cores should return list of all cores.
38) Verify GET /cores/id should return core with specified id.
39) Verify POST /cores should create a new core.
40) Verify PATCH /cores/id should update an already existing core with this specified id.
41) Verify DELETE /cores/id should delete the core with this specified id.
42) User should not see any result when he does a GET query on above specified id.
43) Verify GET /crew should return list of all cores.
44) Verify GET /crew/id should return core with specified id.
45) Verify POST /crew should create a new core.
46) Verify PATCH /crew/id should update an already existing core with this specified id.
47) Verify DELETE /crew/id should delete the core with this specified id.
48) User should not see any result when he does a GET query on above specified id.
49) Verify GET /dragons should return list of all cores.
50) Verify GET /dragons/id should return core with specified id.
51) Verify POST /dragons should create a new core.
52) Verify PATCH /dragons/id should update an already existing core with this specified id.
53) Verify DELETE /dragons/id should delete the core with this specified id.
54) User should not see any result when he does a GET query on above specified id.
